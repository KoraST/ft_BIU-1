# Overview
The SigServer acquires and TiA then ships the stuff to the client(s). In the
future, the SignalServer will also be able to save data and in combination with
TiD (event distribution interface) to dispatch and store the events with the
data.

# Testing tia2ft with artificial signals

Start a signal server:

  $ ./server.sh bin/server_config.xml
