This is a special release of the FieldTrip toolbox code for inclusion
in SPM8. This release has wrapper functions that adhere to the
spm_xxx function naming style. The public functions are available
as ft_xxx, whereas all dependencies are hidden in the private
directory. If you are interested in using this toolbox independent
of SPM8, I suggest that you visit http://www.ru.nl/fcdonders/fieldtrip
and download a normal and more complete version.

under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence as published by
the Free Software Foundation (either version 2, or at your option
any later version). See the file COPYING for more details.
